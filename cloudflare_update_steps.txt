Cloudflare DNS Update Steps for swacktech.com

1. Access Cloudflare Dashboard DNS Settings:
   - Go to swacktech.com domain
   - Navigate to DNS settings

2. Remove Existing Records:
   - Delete current A records pointing to Cloudflare IPs
   - Delete current AAAA records pointing to Cloudflare IPs
   - Delete any existing CNAME records for the root domain

3. Add New A Records:
   For each of these IPs:
   - 216.239.32.21
   - 216.239.34.21
   - 216.239.36.21
   - 216.239.38.21

   Configuration:
   - Type: A
   - Name: @ (root domain)
   - Proxy status: DNS only (gray cloud) temporarily
   - TTL: Auto

4. Add New AAAA Records:
   For each of these IPs:
   - 2001:4860:4802:32::15
   - 2001:4860:4802:34::15
   - 2001:4860:4802:36::15

   Configuration:
   - Type: AAAA
   - Name: @ (root domain)
   - Proxy status: DNS only (gray cloud) temporarily
   - TTL: Auto

5. Wait for Certificate Provisioning:
   - Monitor domain mapping status:
     gcloud beta run domain-mappings describe --domain=swacktech.com --platform managed
   - Wait for certificate provisioning to complete (usually 15-30 minutes)

6. After Certificate is Provisioned:
   - Return to Cloudflare DNS settings
   - Re-enable proxy (orange cloud) for all A and AAAA records
   - Verify HTTPS is working properly

7. SSL/TLS Settings:
   - Set SSL/TLS encryption mode to "Full (strict)"
   - Enable "Always Use HTTPS"
   - Set Minimum TLS Version to 1.2
   - Enable Automatic HTTPS Rewrites

Note: Keep the verify_dns_records.sh script running to monitor the DNS propagation and certificate status.
