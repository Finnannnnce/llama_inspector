Cloudflare SSL Fix for ERR_SSL_VERSION_OR_CIPHER_MISMATCH

1. SSL/TLS Settings:
   - Go to SSL/TLS tab in Cloudflare
   - Change SSL/TLS encryption mode to "Flexible" temporarily
   - Then wait 1 minute and change back to "Full" (not Full Strict)
   - Disable TLS 1.3 temporarily
   - Set Minimum TLS Version to TLS 1.2

2. Edge Certificates:
   - Go to SSL/TLS > Edge Certificates
   - Disable "Always Use HTTPS" temporarily
   - Turn off "Automatic HTTPS Rewrites"
   - Disable "TLS 1.3"
   - Set Minimum TLS Version to TLS 1.2
   - Clear browser cache and DNS cache

3. Wait 5 minutes, then re-enable in this order:
   a. Enable "Always Use HTTPS"
   b. Enable "Automatic HTTPS Rewrites"
   c. Enable TLS 1.3
   d. Change SSL/TLS mode to "Full"

4. Clear Browser Cache:
   Chrome: chrome://net-internals/#sockets
   - Click "Flush socket pools"
   Then go to chrome://net-internals/#dns
   - Click "Clear host cache"

5. Clear OS DNS Cache:
   ```bash
   sudo dscacheutil -flushcache
   sudo killall -HUP mDNSResponder
   ```

6. Verify SSL Connection:
   ```bash
   curl -v https://swacktech.com/_stcore/health
   ```

Note: The key change is using "Full" instead of "Full (strict)" mode since Cloud Run's certificate is already trusted and we don't need the extra validation that strict mode enforces.
