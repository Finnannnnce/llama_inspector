Cloudflare SSL Fix for ERR_SSL_VERSION_OR_CIPHER_MISMATCH (Updated)

1. DNS Settings:
   - Go to DNS tab
   - For all A and AAAA records:
     * Change proxy status to DNS only (grey cloud) temporarily
     * Verify they point to Google Cloud Run IPs:
       A records:
       - 216.239.32.21
       - 216.239.34.21
       - 216.239.36.21
       - 216.239.38.21
       AAAA records:
       - 2001:4860:4802:32::15
       - 2001:4860:4802:34::15
       - 2001:4860:4802:36::15
       - 2001:4860:4802:38::15

2. SSL/TLS Settings:
   - Go to SSL/TLS tab
   - Set SSL/TLS encryption mode to "Off" temporarily
   - Wait 2 minutes
   - Then set to "Flexible"
   - Wait 2 minutes
   - Finally set to "Full" (not Full Strict)

3. Edge Certificates:
   - Go to SSL/TLS > Edge Certificates
   - Disable all options temporarily:
     * Always Use HTTPS: Off
     * Automatic HTTPS Rewrites: Off
     * TLS 1.3: Off
   - Set Minimum TLS Version to TLS 1.2
   - Wait 2 minutes

4. Re-enable features in order:
   a. Enable TLS 1.3
   b. Enable Always Use HTTPS
   c. Enable Automatic HTTPS Rewrites
   d. Change all DNS records back to proxied (orange cloud)

5. Page Rules:
   - Remove any existing page rules
   - Add new rule:
     * URL Pattern: swacktech.com/*
     * Settings:
       - SSL: Full
       - Cache Level: Standard
       - Edge Cache TTL: 2 hours

6. Clear DNS and Browser Cache:
   ```bash
   sudo dscacheutil -flushcache
   sudo killall -HUP mDNSResponder
   ```
   Chrome:
   - Go to chrome://net-internals/#dns
   - Click "Clear host cache"
   - Go to chrome://net-internals/#sockets
   - Click "Flush socket pools"

7. Wait 5-10 minutes for changes to propagate

8. Verify with:
   ```bash
   ./scripts/verify_ssl_fix.sh
   ```

Note: The key is to temporarily disable proxying and gradually re-enable features to ensure proper SSL certificate propagation.
